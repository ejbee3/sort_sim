# Sorting Sim for most sort algorithms
- I have been working through the W3Schools [DSA course](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_intro.php),
  and I really liked the visual aid where they walk you through each iteration of the sorting algorithm loops.
- So basically I'm trying to make a pygame verison of it. The best way I've found to visualize it as closely
  to their version as possible is to make a custom event in pygame and then have a timer go off every half second
  or so.
- It's a work in progress, but I'm learning a lot! I'm starting with Selection Sort because the algorithm
  for that one isn't too difficult to follow along with visually.
